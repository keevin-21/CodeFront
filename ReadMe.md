# **CodeFront**

>**Project Description:**
> Is a Java implementing Springboot that will deploy a website where allows users to fetch and view news articles from multiple online sources in one place. 
> It will retrieve live news data from APIs (such as NewsAPI or RSS feeds) and display headlines and summaries in a 
> user-friendly interface. The news showing will only be technology related where it can be separated into different categories 
> (labels) the articles and news showing, and the user will be able to mark the content to their liking.
